## Introduction

### About Me

My Name is Hotu, and I'm from New Zealand. Before landing a position as an apprentice with Credera I was a chef for about 7 years. While in highschool I had the dream of becoming a snowboard instructor. I finished highschool I moved to a ski town in the hopes of becoming one.Better planing would have told me that I had made the trip too late in the season.Desperate for a job I applied everywhere.My hopes and dreams were dashed, and not wanting to pack up and leave I applied to everywhere I could, luckily a couple guys owned a seasonal pop-up pizza joint in the center of town offered me a job - *after a bit of pestering from myself*. In the 3 and a half years I was a pizza chef I studied culinary arts and helped them build their business by managing sites and opening new sites, etc.

Needing a new challenge I decided to move to Japan and break away from pizza. There I met my Sous Chef who had worked in Michelin starred restaurants. He inspired me to push myself even further and after a year-ish in Japan I decided to go to London and really test my mettle.
I got a job at a 1 star restaurant which was the hardest work, but also the most gratifying. In 2020, as everyone is aware by now, the pandemic hit. The hospitality industry was devastated by the effects of the pandemic.
With a bunch of free time on my hands, I decided to learn how to do some basic coding through Free Code Camp, Codecademy, and Code wars. Restrictions were easing and I was called back into the kitchen where, I found that I no longer had the passion I once had for cooking. This prompted me to get serious about software development. I joined Makers Academy in July 2021, once finished I applied to a bunch of different jobs, one of which being this DevOps apprenticeship with Credera.

## Ticket 1

### Project Background

When joining Credera, depending on client engagements at the time, generally you'll be assigned to the bench to help create/improve internal products, this is only while you're not on a client (external party). While on the bench, I didn't have the opportunity to do much as part of a team.
Every Monday and Wednesday there is a bench stand up where we discuss progress made or blockers on tickets we've been assigned to. You based on your interests, if nothing takes your fancy you will get assigned a ticket based on your experience.

### Ticket Background

This is part of an epic and was created as a ticket. I chose the ticket as it looked interesting and I hadn't done anything like this before. I would assume there were meetings before I was assigned the ticket, as the ticket was created before I joined Credera. I broke the ticket down into 2 steps in the beginning, manually test to see if the requirements are even possible, and then automate the process. The purpose of the ticket is to track resources deployed to AWS for cost and monitoring purposes.

### Learning and Research

I had done a weeks worth of Terraform training before going onto placement. I found a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLTZh3bZd0&ab_channel=Tieho-The-Engineer) of someone explaining the process and how to do it manually. Lots of stack overflow.

### Completing the Ticket

Majority of this task was solo work, a couple of times I got stuck on something to do with Terraform or the way the AWS environment I was deploying to was configured.

In the beginning I had no clue if this was possible, so I spent a lot of time Googling, and a ton of trial and error. I used the Youtube video to see how it would be done manually and then converted it into Terraform. Seeing this I created a diagram of how I thought it was working - *this is the end result, in the beginning it only referenced the creation of S3 buckets*.

![Autotagger Diagram](./images/Autotagger-Diagram.png)

With this in mind, I converted the diagram into Terraform, adding the missing parts that are auto-generated/easily overlooked as it could be a simple click of a button through the UI. My first step was to create a Lambda that would trigger on a specific event, *eg. a user creates an S3 bucket*, and have the Lambda log `Hello, World!`.

#### Trigger Evidence

![trigger evidence](./images/creation-event.png)

Once I had evidence that the creation events were triggering the Lambda, I could then implement the logic that would provide the created resources with new tags.
Using the AWS SDK for python, *Boto3*, I could easily hit the AWS API and create an S3 client, scrape the logs for the bucket name, then provide the S3 client the bucket name, and then with an S3 client built-in function provide the bucket the required tags.

#### Lambda Handler

![lambda handler](./images/lambda-handler.png)

#### Tagging function

![bucket tagging](./images/bucket-tagging.png)

Once deployed, create an S3 bucket and check your newly created bucket, you'll see that there are now tags attached to it:

![tagged bucket](./images/tagged-bucket.png)

Once I could tag a bucket, targeting other resources was very easy, it was just a matter of changing the Boto3 resource I needed. To do this, only three Terraform resources are needed and the code for the lambda making it easy to contribute to and update.

I chose to use Python in this project for three reasons:

* I hadn't used it before, I wanted to challenge myself
* It had minimal setup versus Javascript when using the AWS SDK
* It's quick and easy to pick up
* It looks cleaner

I used Terraform as the IAC as that's what I had the most familiarity with.

### Problems and Solutions

One of the problems I faced when trying to tag S3 buckets, was that Boto3 didn't have a way to cleanly add tags to the bucket. On cretaion, S3 bucket would overwrite any tags it was already provided. I got around this by retrieving the tags that were attached to the bucket on creation and adding them to the list of tags that I wanted to provide.

Another issue I faced when expanding this project to incorporate more than just S3 buckets was, not all AWS resource take tags in the same way, which made this frustrating when I wanted to follow best practices and not repeat code, eg. S3 buckets, the accepted tags are formatted like so:

```python
'TagSet': [
  {'Key': 'CreatedBy', 'Value': user},
  {'Key': 'CreatedOn', 'Value': current_date}
]
```

but if I tried to do the same with an EKS cluster, all it would accept is the following:

```python
{
  'CreatedBy': user,
  'CreatedOn': current_date
}
```

### Conclusion

I was able to implement auto tagging for 5 different resources, S3 buckets, EC2 instances, ECK clusters, ECS clusters, and Glue registries. I made it easy to implement the logic for other resources by documenting thoroughly the approach one should take.
I learned some basic use of Python and deepened my knowledge on Terraform and AWS.
This has helped by allowing Credera to pinpoint when and who created a resource, and track how much these resources are costing the company.
I wrote a step-by-step **[blog](https://medium.com/credera-engineering/auto-tagging-with-aws-and-terraform-246affbf6797)** on how to implement it, as I couldn't find anything in the beginning and thought people could benefit from it. This allowed me to share what I had learned and hopefully help somebody in the future and potentially widen Credera's reach.
