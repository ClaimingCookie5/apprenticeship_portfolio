## Introduction

### About Me

My Name is Hotu, and I'm from New Zealand. Before landing a position as an apprentice with Credera I was a chef for about 7 years. When I was still in highschool and the dream of becoming a snowboard instructor, when I finished highschool I moved to a ski town in the hopes of becoming one.
Better planing would have told me that I had made the trip too late in the season. Desperate for a job I applied everywhere.My hopes and dreams were dashed, and not wanting to pack up and leave I applied to everywhere I could, luckily a couple guys owned a seasonal pop-up pizza joint in the center of town offered me a job - *after a bit of pestering from myself*. In the 3 and a half years I was a pizza chef I studied culinary arts and helped them build their business by managing sites and opening new sites, etc.
Needing a new challenge I decided to move to Japan and break away from pizza. There I met my Sous Chef who had worked in Michelin starred restaurants. He inspired me to push myself even further and after a year-ish in Japan I decided to go to London and really test my mettle.
I got a job at a 1 star restaurant which was the hardest work, but also the most gratifying. In 2020, as everyone is aware by now, the pandemic hit. The hospitality industry was devastated by the effects of the pandemic.
With a bunch of free time on my hands, I decided to learn how to do some basic coding through Free Code Camp, Codecademy, and Code wars. Restrictions were easing and I was called back into the kitchen where, I found that I no longer had the passion I once had for cooking. This prompted me to get serious about software development. I joined Makers Academy in July 2021, once finished I applied to a bunch of different jobs, one of which being this DevOps apprenticeship with Credera.

| K8 | Immutable infrastructure and how it enables continuous refreshing of software, namely the updating of the operating system, container and security patching. | | | | |
| K9 | Different organisational cultures, the development frameworks utilised and how they can both complement each other and introduce constraints on delivery. | | | | |
| K10 | How the user experience sits at the heart of modern development practices in terms of strategies to understand diverse user needs, accessibility and how to drive adoption. | | | | |
| K11 | Monitoring and alerting technologies and an awareness of the insights that can be derived from the infrastructure and applications - collecting logs and metrics, configuring alerting thresholds, firing alerts and visualising data. | | | | |
| K12 | The persistence/data layer, including which database/storage technologies are appropriate to each platform type and application when considering non-functional and functional needs; e.g. monolith, microservice, read heavy, write heavy, recovery plans. | | | | |
| K13 | Automation techniques, such as scripting and use of APIs. | | | | |
| K14 | Test Driven Development and the Test Pyramid. How the practice is underpinned by unit testing, the importance of automation, appropriate use of test doubles and mocking strategies, reducing a reliance on end-to-end testing. | | | | |
| K15 | The principles and application of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, including the differences between them. | | | | |
| K16 | How best to secure data; e.g. encryption in transit, encryption at rest and access control lists (ACL). | | | | |
