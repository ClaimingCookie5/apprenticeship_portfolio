## Introduction

### About Me

My Name is Hotu, and I'm from New Zealand, and before landing a position as an apprentice with Credera I was a chef for about 7 years. When I was still in highschool and the dream of becoming a snowboard instructor, when I finished highschool I moved to a ski town in the hopes of becoming one.
Better planing would have told me that I had made the trip too late in the season. Desperate for a job I applied everywhere.My hopes and dreams were dashed, and not wanting to pack up and leave I applied to everywhere I could, luckily a couple guys owned a seasonal pop-up pizza joint in the center of town offered me a job - *after a bit of pestering from myself*. In the 3 and a half years I was a pizza chef I studied culinary arts and helped them build their business by managing sites and opening new sites, etc.

Needing a new challenge I decided to move to Japan and break away from pizza. There I met my Sous Chef who had worked in Michelin starred restaurants. He inspired me to push myself even further and after a year-ish in Japan I decided to go to London and really test my mettle.
I got a job at a 1 star restaurant which was the hardest work, but also the most gratifying. About
